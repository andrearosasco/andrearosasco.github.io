I'm a Research Fellow at the [Center for Robotics and Intelligent System (CRIS)](https://www.iit.it/it/cris-sanquirico) of the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT) working as part of the **Humanoid Sensing and Perception team**. My works is primarly focused on designing and implementing **Computer Vision alorithms for robotic perception**. I like to keep up to date with the developments in different and unrelated areas of Deep Learning as a way to produce original research by combining techniques coming from various fields.

I received my MS Degree in *Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence* from University of Pisa in 2021, supervised by Davide Bacciu, Antonio Carta and Andrea Cossu with a thesis on Continual Learning, later turned into the paper *"Distilled Replay: Overcoming Forgetting through Synthetic Samples"* with the help of Vincenzo Lomonaco.
