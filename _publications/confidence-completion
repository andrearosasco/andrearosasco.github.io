title: "Towards Confidence-guided Shape Completion for Robotic Applications"
collection: publications
permalink: https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04300
excerpt: 'In this paper, we propose an object shape completion method based on an implicit 3D representation providing a confidence value for each reconstructed point. As a second contribution, we introduce a gradient-based method for efficiently sampling such implicit function at an arbitrary resolution, tunable at inference time.'
